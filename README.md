EatThis
=======

This script called __EatThis!__ was created to gratify European Union law enforcement to inform about using cookies. Almost all sites uses it to store session data, serve ads and collect statistics about user behavior, so you probably need script like this.

I created __EatThis__ basically with these statements in mind:

1. __Easy-to-use__ - it must be easy to apply script to any site.
2. __Lightweight__ & __Standalone__ - to not bloat or force site to use one of JS toolkits.
3. __Noninvasive__ & __Styleable__ - to not deface good appearance of website.

It was planned to sell, so quality should be quite good.

### How does it work?

After installation, script will show info panel on the bottom of browser window until user click "Close". Information about it is stored in cookie so panel won't show up next time.

### Features

* Elegant, non invasive, scalable bar at bottom of page.
* Small footprint - about 4kB (plain) or 2.5kB (min&gzip).
* Configurable texts, URL to Cookie Policy and cookie storage parameters.
* Styleable thanks to LESS - just change color values and compile to get new CSS file.
* 8 predefined, ready to use, universal stylesheets.
* Detailed [documentation](TODO: url)
* Available [Demo](TODO: url)
